## Basics:

The character `#` allows you to comment, this is escaped in `""` strings.

## Basic terms:
  
A "module" or "library" is something made by someone that you can import into your own code.

A function is a group of code that you can run as many times as you want by "calling" it.

To "call" a function is to run the code inside of it. If you have a function named "doThings" (don't **ever** actually name your function that, be descriptive), then you would call it like this: `doThings()`
